Implementation of common object oriented data structures in JavaScript along with common algorithm solutions and approaches 

PURPOSE: 
    -To implement OOP designs generally taught in Java (or C++) with JavaScript i
    -To better grasp algorithm complexity. For each problem I try to improve upon or implement each solution in another way (generally this means making it a more functional design as opposed to my procedural design apporach)


TO DO: 
    -Test cases
    -Problem sets/solutons upon actual data structures
    -more algs coming soon- in particular functional ones along with manipulating objects
